# NumberTheory
This is the second lab in the Programming Languages course that deals with implementing number theory concepts in Haskell.

For the graduate portion, this lab also implements the concepts in the Groovy language.

The first part of the lab is to output a list of perfect numbers up to a given number _n_.

The second part simply generates prime numbers in Groovy and in Haskell utilizes list comprehensions.
